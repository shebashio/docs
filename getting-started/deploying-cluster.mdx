## Deploying an ephemeral cluster

A key feature of the D3DZ3D environment is its ability to rapidly deploy ephemeral Kubernetes clusters. These clusters come pre-configured to your specifications with Big Bang applications. This provides everyone with a DevSecOps-compliant ephemeral environment for two main purposes: rapid testing of Big Bang integrations and hands-on training in Big Bang deployment to Kubernetes.

To start, open your browser to [https://dedzed.dso.sh](https://dedzed.dso.sh).

<Tip>
Watch the guided tutorial below to understand the deployment flow.

## Create a new environment from the DEDZED Command Dashboard

To create a new environment from the DEDZED Command Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Go to [dedzed.dso.sh](https://dedzed.dso.sh) and authenticate using your Ping login.
2. Click on **Environments** to select your cloud provider (e.g., **AKS**).
3. Customize the cluster components, such as the cluster name and the applications to install (e.g., **ArgoCD**, **GitLab**, and **Vault**).
4. Enter a valid GitHub.com account for accessing the **flux** monitored **git repository**.
5. Choose between a vanilla cluster or **Big Bang** included for additional components.
6. Set the environment time to live (default is **7** hours).
7. Submit the request and wait for about **20 minutes** for the setup to complete.
8. Monitor the progress in the table, including **GitHub actions** and **Terraform** **workspaces**.
9. Wait for the cluster to become available by checking for the **Explore Cluster** and **DEDZED AI** icons.
10. Access the **Service Endpoints** section to view **DNS hostnames** of web-based services.
11. Use the **Explore Cluster** button within a KASM Workspace session to check deployment status.
12. Monitor the deployment progress of selected services like **ArgoCD**, **Vault**, and **GitLab** using **k9s**.
13. Check the **readiness** of services by ensuring pods are running and in a **ready** state.
14. Wait for all services to be fully available before accessing and using them.
15. Once all services are running, you can interact with your ephemeral **Kubernetes** cluster equipped with **Big Bang** components.
