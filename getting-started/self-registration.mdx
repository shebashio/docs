## Exclusion list for users with CAC issues

<Warning>
**Only in cases where a user cannot sign in with their registered CAC.**
</Warning>

1. Please reach out to the SHE BASH admins at [Contact and Support](/support/contact) if you encounter issues logging in with your CAC. The SHE BASH team will work with you to try to resolve the issue, but in cases where it can't be resolved, a user can be added to the CAC exclusion list.

2. Once an admin has added you to the exclusion list, you can sign in to DEDZED resources without a CAC by using your DEDZED account (`firstname.lastname@usa.dev`) username, password, and a Microsoft-compatible MFA setup of your choice (you can also choose to skip MFA setup).
