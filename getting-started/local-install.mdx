Do I have to install anything on my local machine to use DEDZED?
</Note>

No, DEDZED does not require you to install any software on your machine. Instead, it uses a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) called Kasm that you access through a web browser. The main requirements are:

- A Chromium-based browser (like Chrome or Edge) for the best experience, though other browsers can work if necessary
- Access to the Kasm VDI at [https://kasm.icbm.dev](https://kasm.icbm.dev)
- Authentication using your Ping login

All the necessary tools and environments are provided within the Kasm VDI, eliminating the need for local software installation.
