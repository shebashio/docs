## Create your desktop

To access a Kasm Workspace (ephemeral VDI in your browser) navigate to [https://kasm.dedzed.dso.sh](https://kasm.dedzed.dso.sh).

1. Authenticate using the account you created (ends in `@usa.dev`)
2. Select between a Windows 11 Desktop or Ubuntu Desktop.
   - If you want your data to persist after your VDI session is over, choose **Persistent Profile: Enabled**
   - If you want a truly ephemeral experience, choose **Persistent Profile: Disabled**
