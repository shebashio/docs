If you need specific software for your work that isn't available through the listed methods, please submit a request!
</Note>

## SHE BASH Ubuntu

While you cannot freely install any software in the DEDZED VDI, there are some options available. Here is a list of methods:

- You can run Docker containers within the VDI environment.
- You have the ability to install software as a non-root user.
- The environment comes with pre-installed software and tools.
- You can request additional software to be installed. For instance, a user requested a Go compiler during our alpha testing period, which is now ready to use in Beta!

## Windows 11

- You will have access to the same suite of pre-installed tools on your Windows 11 machine as you do on the Ubuntu image, ensuring consistency across platforms. However, one key difference is that you'll be granted administrative control on the Windows 11 environment. This elevated privilege allows you to install additional software as required by your specific needs, providing greater flexibility in customizing your workspace.
- While we encourage you to tailor your environment to best suit your work requirements, we kindly request that you exercise this freedom responsibly. It is crucial to maintain the integrity and security of the shared infrastructure. Therefore, we strongly emphasize the importance of refraining from intentionally introducing any form of malicious code onto the systems. Additionally, we ask that you avoid any actions that could potentially disrupt or negatively impact the experience of other users sharing the DEDZED VDI environment. Your cooperation in this matter helps ensure a safe, stable, and productive working environment for all team members.

Your feedback is essential! Our team rapidly implements new features based on your needs.

If you need specific software for your work that isn't available through these methods, it's still recommended to submit a request:

- **(Preferred)** Launch your VDI session, open TSEC, and submit your request via the Feedback widget.
- Request specific software in the Beta Teams channel.

This allows the DEDZED team to evaluate the request and potentially add the software to the environment!
