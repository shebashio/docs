description: "Understanding the benefits of ephemeral environments in DEDZED"
---

### Environments in DEDZED are ephemeral for several reasons:

- **Cost efficiency**: Ephemeral environments help control operational costs by automatically destroying resources after a set time, preventing unnecessary ongoing expenses.
- **Security**: Temporary environments reduce the attack surface and potential for data breaches by limiting the lifespan of sensitive data and resources.
- **Flexibility**: Ephemeral environments allow for rapid creation and removal of desktops for tool creation, evaluation, and testing without long-term commitments.
- **Consistent testing**: Each new ephemeral environment provides a clean slate, ensuring consistent and reproducible testing conditions for software builds.
- **Resource management**: By limiting the number of concurrent environments a user can request, DEDZED ensures efficient resource allocation and prevents overuse.

<Tip>
These ephemeral environments align with DEDZED's goal of providing a secure, flexible, and cost-effective platform for rapid software development and testing in high-security contexts.
