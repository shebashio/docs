<Note>
DEDZED AI brings agentic AI capabilities across the DEDZED platform — from your Kasm workspace to the DEDZED Command Dashboard and the Shredder Security Platform.
</Note>

## Kasm workspace agent

DEDZED AI is available as an agentic coding assistant in your Kasm workspace, powered by Claude Code. You can interact with it directly from your terminal to manage clusters, write and debug code, and streamline your development workflow.

<Warning>
You must bring your own Claude subscription account or API key to use the DEDZED AI agent in your Kasm workspace.
</Warning>

## DEDZED Command Dashboard

DEDZED AI is integrated into the DEDZED Command Dashboard, where it performs dashboard operations on your behalf — deploying environments, managing cluster configurations, and automating routine tasks.

## Shredder Security Platform

DEDZED AI is built into the Shredder Security Platform to analyze vulnerabilities discovered in application scans. It provides actionable insights and remediation guidance to help you resolve security findings faster.
